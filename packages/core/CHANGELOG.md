### Minor Changes

- [#19](https://github.com/simonliu-ai-product/open-doc/pull/19) [`7040726`](https://github.com/simonliu-ai-product/open-doc/commit/7040726f2ecf431a6e4750f216ce4903f3c9ccc9) Thanks [@LiuYuWei](https://github.com/LiuYuWei)! - Add `<Diagram>`: import a `.mmd` file and get an architecture or flow drawing compiled to SVG at build time, in the document's own theme, numbered as a figure when given a caption.

  - **`open-doc check`** renders every sheet at true page size and reports the layout faults an agent writing React cannot see — content clipped by the page edge, blank sheets, headings stranded at the foot of a page, type too small to print, images that never loaded — each with the `line:column` in the source. Exits non-zero, so it works as a CI gate. Same report as the new `check_layout` MCP tool; `render_page` returns a PNG of one sheet.
  - **`open-doc export [ids…] --format pdf|html|png`** produces the Download menu's output from a script. It drives the real viewer in headless Chromium, so nothing about layout is re-implemented on the Node side. Playwright is an optional peer, not a dependency.
  - **`open-doc import <file.md>`** turns Markdown into a real document — `flow()` body, cover, self-filling contents, GFM tables, local images copied into the document's `assets/`. The output is ordinary authored TSX, so the outline, the inspector, and the design panel all work on it. Also available as the `import_markdown` tool.
  - **Fixed:** the flow packer's `measuring` flag read false for one commit after a document loaded, so anything reading the page list in that window — the outline scan, thumbnails, the page counter — saw an unpaginated flow section as a single page.

  - **`<Footnote>`** — numbered by position across the whole document, printed at the foot of whatever page its marker landed on. Inside a `flow()` section the notes are lifted out of the blocks *before* measurement and their height is charged to the page budget, so the packer breaks pages knowing what the foot of each one already owes. Fixed pages place them with an explicit `<Footnotes />`.
  - **`<Figure caption id>`** (`kind="table"` for tables) — numbered from a scan of the rendered pages, caption and content in one unbreakable block, with `<ListOfFigures />` / `<ListOfTables />` to build the lists.
  - **`<Ref to="id" />`** — renders `Figure 3`, and appends the page only when the target is on another sheet. A reference to an id nothing declares renders visibly and is reported by `open-doc check` as a new `unresolved-ref` error.
  - **`meta.labels`** — what numbered things are called (`圖`, `表`, `（第 {page} 頁）`). The numbering itself is structural.
  - **`<DataTable>` + `.csv`/`.tsv` imports** — data files resolve to arrays of objects at build time (quoted fields, embedded newlines, CRLF), and the table infers alignment and grouping from the column's contents. Data is never fetched at render time: the packer measures the real DOM, so anything arriving a tick later arrives after the layout is decided.
  - **Fixed:** `stackedHeights` measured the last node of every measurement container after the first as zero, because it mixed `offsetTop` (host-relative) with the container's own height. It now takes both from the same box, which corrects footnote reservation and the last block of every flow section after the first.

### Patch Changes

- [#19](https://github.com/simonliu-ai-product/open-doc/pull/19) [`7040726`](https://github.com/simonliu-ai-product/open-doc/commit/7040726f2ecf431a6e4750f216ce4903f3c9ccc9) Thanks [@LiuYuWei](https://github.com/LiuYuWei)! - Resolve `@open-document/mcp` from the workspace running the dev server, so `--mcp` mounts under pnpm's strict node_modules layout instead of silently disabling itself.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- [#12](https://github.com/simonliu-ai-product/open-doc/pull/12) [`40e8f98`](https://github.com/simonliu-ai-product/open-doc/commit/40e8f9810b3d8f51264b72974af10e8a3d137cab) Thanks [@LiuYuWei](https://github.com/LiuYuWei)! - Publish the reader's position to `node_modules/.open-doc/current.json` while `open-doc dev` runs, and ship a `current-doc` skill so an agent can resolve "this page" and "this element" without asking. The cursor carries the document id, the rendered page number, the source path, and whatever the inspector has selected; a selection clears when you move to another sheet.

### Patch Changes

- [#13](https://github.com/simonliu-ai-product/open-doc/pull/13) [`fa2f15f`](https://github.com/simonliu-ai-product/open-doc/commit/fa2f15f7ae284b3020be0fb90979ac28288ffeec) Thanks [@LiuYuWei](https://github.com/LiuYuWei)! - Move to vite 8, `@vitejs/plugin-react` 6, and `@babel/parser` 8. Build output keeps its `.js` / `.d.ts` names — tsdown 0.22 would otherwise rename everything to `.mjs` / `.d.mts` and break the exports map.

- [#10](https://github.com/simonliu-ai-product/open-doc/pull/10) [`d70eafe`](https://github.com/simonliu-ai-product/open-doc/commit/d70eafe811dd8334334c403672c69e38b055a5ad) Thanks [@LiuYuWei](https://github.com/LiuYuWei)! - Mark the viewer's scrolling pane with `data-od-viewer` so page frames in the main pane can be told apart from the thumbnail rail.
